        <h3>My Journey in Software Enginnering</h3>
        <article>
            <p>My name is Tendo Calvin. I am a software engineer with interests in AI/ML, Full-stack
            developement and DevOps engineering. My passion for software engineering was birthed
            after I finished my internship period at Stratcom Technologies where I was tasked on fields like
            cyber security, full-stack developement and networking. I was able to learn languanges like
            JavaScript and python. In the long run, I aim to learn Java as well.</p>
